üìù Text Editor System üñ•Ô∏è
This project implements a text editor system that allows users to perform various operations on a text file. Here's a breakdown of the functionalities and components of the system:

üîµ Components:
Hashing: Implements a hash table to efficiently store and retrieve text data from the file.
Trie: Provides functionality for prefix/postfix lookup and sorting of text data.
Queue, Stack, DLL: Data structures used for managing user actions, search history, and undo/redo functionality.
HeapSort: Implements the heap sort algorithm for sorting data lexicographically.
Regular Expression Matching: Allows users to perform searches using regular expressions (postfix or prefix).
File I/O: Handles reading from and writing to the text file.

üîµFunctionalities:
Search: Users can search for text within the file using the hash table.
Edit: Allows users to edit text that has been searched and update the file accordingly.
Undo/Redo: Supports undoing and redoing search and edit actions.
Remove/Add Data: Users can remove or add data from/to the file.
Sort Data: Provides options for sorting data lexicographically or alphabetically using trie.
Regular Expression Lookup: Enables users to perform advanced searches using regular expressions.
History Display: Displays a history of user actions during the session.

üîµUsage:
Launch the application and select from the menu options to perform actions.
Use numerical input to navigate through menu options and perform actions.
Search for text, edit text, remove or add data, undo/redo actions, and more.
Sort data, perform regular expression lookups, and view the history of actions taken.
Exit the editor when done, and changes will be saved to the text file.

üîµHow to Run:
Compile the source code using a C++ compiler that supports C++11 features.
Ensure all necessary header files and libraries are included.
Run the compiled executable to start the text editor system.
Follow on-screen prompts and use the menu to interact with the system.
